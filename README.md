A cross-platform Discord music bot with a clean interface, and that is easy to set up and run yourself!

**Note:** This fork is not affiliated with the original JMusicBot. It was created in response to certain antifeatures the developer decided to implement, and this fork has henceforth removed.

## Setup
Please see the [Setup Page](https://jmusicbot.com/setup) to run this bot yourself!

## Editing
This bot (and the source code here) might not be easy to edit for inexperienced programmers. The main purpose of having the source public is to show the capabilities of the libraries, to allow others to understand how the bot works, and to allow those knowledgeable about java, JDA, and Discord bot development to contribute. There are many requirements and dependencies required to edit and compile it, and there will not be support provided for people looking to make changes on their own. Instead, consider making a feature request (see the above section). If you choose to make edits, please do so in accordance with the Apache 2.0 License.
